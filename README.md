## Project Name Mail_parse
Project to Parse Emails with extension eml

Mailparse is an extension for parsing and working with email messages. It can deal with » RFC 822 and » RFC 2045 (MIME) compliant messages.

Mailparse is stream based, which means that it does not keep in-memory copies of the files it processes - so it is very resource efficient when dealing with large messages.
